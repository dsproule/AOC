## Submission

### This submission includes the source code for 6 problems (Days 1-5, Day 7). Every solution is implemented in CPP first (as I felt it was quicker to debug the algorithms).

## Directory Structure
```
.
|- rtl/
    |- src/
    |- tb/
|- sw/
|- inputs/
```

- The SW contains the CPP/Python code. The inputs are my generated AOC puzzle inputs and the rtl directory contains all the SystemVerilog.
- The Makefile automates all deployment. "make aocN_ext" can be used to automatically run any of the scripts or eleborate and simulate the rtl. 

For example. day 1 sv and cpp can be used via
```
make aoc1_sv
make aoc1_hw_cpp
```
